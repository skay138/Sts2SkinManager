## [0.11.4] - 2026-05-15

### Changed — character suggestion algorithm rewrite
- **Dual-encoding byte-pattern matching.** v0.11.0–.3 character suggester only scanned ASCII bytes — but every .NET-based mod stores its `CHARACTER.{X}` enum constants and `ResourceLoader.Load("res://...")` path strings as UTF-16 in the assembly user-string heap. Without UTF-16 awareness we were blind to the most reliable signal in any DLL-driven character skin (Hcxmmx_Touhou_Sakuya_Skin.dll has `SILENT` ×2 in UTF-16 and zero ASCII hits).
- **Weighted scoring with dominance rule.** New scoring per character id:
  - `+5` per `characters/{id}/` ASCII match in pck (literal asset override)
  - `+5` per `characters/{id}/` UTF-16 match in dll (ResourceLoader path)
  - `+3` per `{ID_UPPERCASE}` UTF-16 match in dll (CHARACTER.{X} enum)
  - `+1` per `{id}` UTF-16 match in dll (any user-string ref)
  
  Selection requires top score ≥ 4 AND top score ≥ 2× runner-up. ASCII-inside-DLL matches are intentionally not scored (random alignment inside DLL metadata produces noisy hits — Sts2CardAdvisor's DLL has 16-66 ASCII matches per character, would have falsely-classified to "defect" under v0.11.3).
- **Why this scales without per-mod maintenance:** any mod that targets a single base character must reference that character's id somewhere in its IL — as an enum constant, an asset path, or a string literal. Mods that touch every character (advisors, save tools) hit no clear single dominant character. The detection now follows directly from "what does the binary actually reference," not from hand-curated keywords or type whitelists.

### Detection priority (final)
1. Concrete-character patch on `CharacterModel.{Defect/Ironclad/...}` — strongest signal, used as-is.
2. Dual-encoding byte-pattern scan (this release) — handles all mainstream DLL-driven skin patterns.
3. Manifest keyword scan (v0.11.3) — fallback for the tiny fraction of mods whose IL has zero character refs (mods that load asset paths via reflection-built strings).
4. Otherwise: log as ambiguous with manifest excerpt + manual-edit instructions.

## [0.11.3] - 2026-05-15

### Added
- **Manifest keyword fallback for character suggestion.** When the byte-frequency suggester finds zero base-character hits in a mod's pck/dll (common for mods authored outside the English-speaking community — e.g. `Hcxmmx_Touhou_Sakuya_Skin`'s description says "替换静默猎手外观" with no English "silent" anywhere in the binary), Skin Manager now scans the mod's `mod_manifest.json` `name` + `description` against a localized keyword table (English + Simplified/Traditional Chinese + Japanese + Korean) and uses the result as a third-tier fallback.
- **Ambiguous-mod logs now print manifest excerpt.** When all three suggesters fail, the log line includes the mod's manifest `name` and (truncated) `description` so the user can see at a glance what character it likely targets, plus a copy-paste JSON snippet for adding to `_dll_skin_assignments` or `_dll_skin_skipped`.

### Detection priority
1. Concrete-character patch (`CharacterModel.Defect/Ironclad/Necrobinder/Regent/Silent`) — strongest signal, used as-is.
2. Byte-frequency over pck + dll bytes — single dominant base-character ID.
3. Manifest keyword scan — localized character names in `name`/`description`.
4. Otherwise: log as ambiguous with manifest excerpt + manual-edit instructions.

## [0.11.2] - 2026-05-15

### Added
- **Wider Harmony spine whitelist.** Detection now also flags patches on the concrete character subclasses (`MegaCrit.Sts2.Core.Models.Characters.Defect/Ironclad/Necrobinder/Regent/Silent`), `NCharacterSelectScreen`, `NTopBarPortrait`, and `NVfxSpine`. A patch on a concrete character class short-circuits straight to that character — no byte-frequency guess needed.
- **Forensic boot log for unclassified DLL+pck mods.** Every boot, Skin Manager prints a list of mods that ship both a `.dll` and a `.pck` but have neither standard skin paths in their pck nor Harmony patches on a whitelisted type. For each, the byte-frequency suggester also prints its best character guess (or "no hint"). This gives the user a durable trail for DLL-skin patterns we don't yet auto-detect — they can copy the printed JSON snippet into `_dll_skin_assignments` (to manage) or `_dll_skin_skipped` (to silence).
- **Visibility log for existing assignments / skipped.** Every boot lists current `_dll_skin_assignments` and `_dll_skin_skipped` contents so the user doesn't need to grep the JSON to see what Skin Manager believes.

## [0.11.1] - 2026-05-15

### Fixed
- **False positives from sister mods.** The v0.11.0 dll-skin sweep flagged Sts2CardAdvisor (and would have flagged any inggom Sts2-prefixed sister mod) as a possible character skin because it patches `NCharacterSelectButton` for advisor-overlay reasons. Auto-blocking that mod's DLL would silently disable the advisor on the next boot. Mods whose id starts with `Sts2` are now skipped before suggestion, alongside an explicit non-skin allowlist (`BaseLib` etc.).
- **"Restart later" no longer leaves stale assignments.** Cancelling the v0.11 dll-skin restart modal previously kept the auto-written `_dll_skin_assignments` on disk, so the next boot would still apply them. Cancel now reverts only the keys that this session added (pre-existing assignments are preserved).

### Migration note
- If you booted v0.11.0 once with sister mods installed, open `<user_data>/Sts2SkinManager/skin_choices.json` and remove any `_dll_skin_assignments` entries pointing at `Sts2*` mods (e.g. `"Sts2CardAdvisor": "ironclad"`). v0.11.1 won't add them back.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-05-15

### Added
- **DLL-driven character skin auto-detection.** Mods that swap a base character via Harmony patches (rather than overriding `animations/characters/{char}/...` paths in their pck — e.g. Hcxmmx_King_Skin replacing the Regent with Dead Cells' King) are now picked up automatically. After every other mod finishes initializing, Skin Manager walks `Harmony.GetAllPatchedMethods()` and flags any mod whose patches touch character-spine types (`CharacterModel`, `NCreatureVisuals`, `NCharacterSelectButton`, `MegaSprite`, `NMerchantCharacter`, `NRestSiteCharacter`). For each flagged mod, a byte-frequency scan over its pck + dll suggests which base character it targets; high-confidence matches get auto-assigned and a single restart modal lets you toggle them like any other skin from the next boot onward.
- New `_dll_skin_assignments` (modId → base character id) and `_dll_skin_skipped` (mods you marked as not-a-skin) keys in `skin_choices.json`. Once assigned, the v0.7.0 DLL-load block path automatically blocks the DLL when a different variant is selected.
- 16-language coverage for the new `dll_skin_modal_title` / `dll_skin_modal_body_summary` keys (full translations for EN/KO/JA/ZHS/ZHT/DE/FR/ES/IT/PT-BR/PT/PL/RU/TH/TR; ESP shares SPA).

### Internal
- New `Discovery/HarmonyPatchInspector.cs` (whitelist-driven Harmony scan + assembly→modId map), `Discovery/CharacterIdSuggester.cs` (token-boundary base-character-id frequency counter, threshold 3+ hits with margin 2), `Runtime/DllSkinDetectionService.cs` (defers 2 s after Initialize, writes assignments + shows modal). `SkinModScanner.Scan` now accepts an optional assignments dict and injects assigned mods as Character variants even when their pck has zero standard skin paths.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-05-15

### Added
- **Recursive `mods/` scan.** Skin Manager's pck discovery now walks the entire `mods/` tree at any depth, so users can organize pcks under category folders like `mods/Characters/`, `mods/Artwork/`, `mods/Utility/` and they'll still be picked up. Hidden / `__MACOSX` / dotted folders are skipped. Duplicate pck filenames across subfolders log a warning and the first occurrence wins.

### Documentation
- README EN/KO clarify that STS2 itself also walks `mods/` recursively (`ModManager.ReadModsInDirRecursive`), so DLL+manifest+pck bundles work at any depth — **delete the original `mods/<modName>/` folder after relocating**, otherwise the framework discovers both copies and reports `DUPLICATE_ID`.

### Internal
- Auto-junction prototype (PR #2/#3) was reverted in PR #4 once `sts2.dll` decompilation confirmed the framework already handles nested mod folders natively. No runtime shim is needed.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-05-14

### Added
- **Configurable overlay anchor.** The character-select overlay can now be docked to either the **top-left** (original layout) or the **top-right** corner. Switch live via the optional [ModConfig (Nexus #27)](https://www.nexusmods.com/slaythespire2/mods/27) dropdown — *Overlay position (character select)*. Without ModConfig installed, the mod silently uses the default.
- Overlay layout is now **anchor-based** instead of absolute pixel coordinates — stays correctly placed across resolutions and aspect ratios. `AnchorTopLeft` / `AnchorTopRight` helpers in `SkinSelectorOverlay`; `ModConfigBridge.cs` mirrors the reflection-based pattern used by Sts2ShopVarianceTuner (zero hard dependency on ModConfig).

### Changed
- **Overlay default position is now Top Right** (was Top Left in v0.8 and earlier). The change avoids collision with the multiplayer lobby panel and other UI the game itself parks in the top-left corner of Character Select. Users who prefer the original layout can flip it back to Top Left via the ModConfig dropdown — the change applies immediately, no restart required.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-05-13

### Added
- **Modpack preset sharing.** Every Save now mirrors the current selection to `<sts2>/mods/Sts2SkinManager/modpack_preset.json`. To share a full modpack with a friend, zip your `mods/` folder and send it — on first launch their `skin_choices.json` is seeded from the bundled preset, so dropdown picks, card-skin order, and mixed-mod toggles all apply automatically without anyone having to touch the Roaming/AppData folder.
- README "Sharing your setup" section in both EN and KO with a warning that Nexus release zips must not contain `modpack_preset.json`.

### Notes
- Preset seeding only happens when `<user_data>/Sts2SkinManager/skin_choices.json` doesn't exist yet. Existing users with saved choices are unaffected.
- If a preset references a mod that isn't installed on the recipient's machine, that selection falls back to `default` via the existing `SyncAvailableVariants` path. The recipient's `Save` then mirrors the fallback back into the preset, so re-sharing carries the corrected state forward.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-05-13

### Added
- **DLL load blocking for non-active character mods.** Second Harmony patch on `ModManager.TryLoadMod` intercepts and skips DLL load for any character skin mod that isn't the currently selected variant (or an enabled mixed mod). Without this, mods like `Booba-Necrobinder-Mod` would register Harmony patches that force-override `CharacterModel.CreateVisuals` (scale `0.12`, position `(40, -250)`, skeleton swap) on every instance of the base character — even when you'd selected a completely different skin. Block list rebuilds every boot from `skin_choices.json`.
- **Restart modal on first-boot self-bootstrap.** When `LoadOrderEnforcer` reorders `settings.save` to put SkinManager first in the mod list, a 10-second countdown modal now appears (previously only a `Logger.Warn` line). Without restart, this session's character mods that loaded before SkinManager still have their Harmony patches live; the restart is what makes blocking actually take effect.
- 16-language coverage for the new `load_order_modal_title` / `load_order_modal_body` strings.

### Changed
- `RestartCountdownModal.ShowOrReset` accepts optional `titleKey` / `bodyKey` parameters so the same modal infrastructure can carry different copy for the load-order vs. skin-change cases.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-13

### Added
- **Mixed-mod awareness.** Mods that bundle a character spine with card art / event scenes (e.g. AncientWaifus) are now detected as mixed. They appear in the character dropdown with a `📦` indicator (selecting one applies spine + extras together) AND in a new "Mixed mods" panel, where you can toggle them independently to layer their extras on top of a different main-spine pick (the dropdown's character pick always wins spine conflicts).
- **Boot mount priority.** Mixed addons are mounted first (in reverse-priority order); the dropdown's main-spine choice is mounted last so it overrides any conflicting paths.
- **Collapsible Skin Manager section.** The whole UI is now wrapped in a single toggle header (`▶ 스킨 매니저`) — collapsed by default to keep Character Select clean. Save / Discard stay visible alongside the toggle no matter what state the body is in.
- **Tabbed inner layout.** Card-skin and mixed-mod sections live as tabs inside one panel — only one row list shows at a time, with a generous content area when expanded.
- 16-language coverage for every new key (mixed panel + skin manager header).

### Changed
- Dropdown item text for mixed mods is prefixed with `📦` and ships an explicit per-item tooltip (`SetItemTooltip`) so popup hover surfaces the explanation reliably.
- Inline help label inside the Mixed mod tab so the explanation is always visible without depending on hover tooltips.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added
- **Per-mod display aliases.** Rename any character variant or card skin from the in-game panel — click ✏️, type a friendly name, ✓ to save (Enter also saves) or ✕ to cancel. The mod ID stays as the unique key; aliases are cosmetic and never break matching.
- **Alias uniqueness validation.** Names that collide with another mod ID or another alias are rejected inline (red highlight + tooltip explaining the conflict).

### Fixed
- **Custom-character mods are no longer blocked.** Mods that add brand-new characters (e.g. Ryoshu) had their `.pck` auto-mount intercepted because they shared the `animations/characters/{char}/` path pattern with skin mods, causing the character to disappear from Character Select. SkinManager now reads the base-game roster from `SlayTheSpire2.pck` and only manages mods that target a base character; custom-character mods stay auto-mountable.
- The ✏️ rename button stayed enabled after switching to a character that had no detected skin variants.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added
- Skin preview on hover. Character skins: hover the 👁 icon beside the dropdown. Card skins: hover the row label. Sources: `{ModFolder}/preview.png|jpg|jpeg|webp` (author convention) or auto-extracted from the `.pck` (character-select art for characters, first card art for card packs). 120 ms hide-debounce to handle cursor traversal.
- Godot 4 PCK v2/v3 parser and `.ctex` WebP/PNG decoder so previews work without mounting the `.pck`.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added
- Unified Save / Discard pattern: character dropdown and card-skin panel share a single Save button; one click, one modal, one restart.
- Drag-and-drop reordering for card skins with on/off ✓/✗ status icons.

### Changed
- "Card packs" naming → "Card skins" across all 16 languages.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-12

### Changed
- Card-pack panel UX polish: `ScrollContainer`, collapsible header, explicit order numbers, top-wins priority order with one-shot schema migration.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added
- Card pack management: auto-detection of card-skin mods, JSON schema for ordering/enabled state, in-game UI panel, and integration with STS2's `settings.save` mod list.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-05-12

### Fixed
- Overlay was lost when the user changed STS2 language at runtime; now re-attached via `LocManager.SubscribeToLocaleChange`.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-12

### Changed
- Modal body wording and dropdown placeholder strings clarified across all locales.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-12

### Added
- i18n support — UI follows STS2's current language. 16 locales bundled; missing keys fall back to English.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added
- Initial public release. Detects character-skin `.pck` mods, blocks their auto-mount, and mounts the chosen variant per character via an in-game dropdown on Character Select. Restart confirmation modal with auto-restart through Steam.
